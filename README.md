# Vityl

**Vityl** is an iOS app that digitizes users' physical music collections—vinyl records into a virtual library. Inspired by Letterboxd (a social platform for sharing and reviewing films), Vityl aims to bring the music community together by showcasing collections, sharing opinions, and fostering engagement around music. 

This project marks my first attempt at creating this iOS app and serves as a foundation for a broader platform I’m building for the music community.
